    "The input matrix is typically very sparse: most $x_{i,j}, \\ i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m \\}, \\ j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n \\}$ are empty. The information that *is* contained in the input matrix  is encoded in a latent space by the product of output matrices. The column dimension of the output can be denoted by $k$ where $k \\ll \\{m, n\\}$. The choice of loss function is dependent upon the problem space represented by the input matrix.\n",

    "This technique has a variety of practical applications. Matrix factorization was used by the winners of the famous [Netlix Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) and is commonly referred to as *collaborative filtering* in the recommendation system domain."
